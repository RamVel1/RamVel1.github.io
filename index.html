<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Dear Reader,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Let me start with a situation that I went through a couple of months ago. I was travelling on the highway, and noticed that there were piles of organic waste in a landfill site. The organic waste, which contained fruits and vegetables, was just </span><span style="font-size:1.29em">sitting in the middle of the landfil amongst toxic waste and plastic garbage.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">I knew that a lot of this material could in fact be composted. After going home, I did a little bit of research, and found that around a quarter of the waste material in landfills was organic waste which could have been composted, instead of being sent to the landfill.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">I wanted to do something about this, so I decided to make my own composting bin. Naturally, there would be challenges throughout the process. I live in a high-rise apartment, so there were 2 challenges: space, and the smell. I decided to tackle both of these challenges, by making a composting bin which took up a little bit of space, and produced no smell at all.&#160;</span></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:1.29em">Have you wondered why this is an e-book, and not an actual book?&#160;</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">That's because I tried to be as sustainable as possible while completing my project. Making an e-book saves a lot of&#160;paper, and is environmentally-friendly. Throughout this book and guide, you will find that I have reused material as well to be sustainable.&#160;</span></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">This book is intended to be a helpful guide for home composting. In this e-book, you will find detailed steps and photos on how to com</span><span style="font-size:1.29em">post at your home, and see results within one week.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">I hope you find this book easy to navigate, and enjoy reading this book!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Happy composting!</span></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
