<ol>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Make sure you keep the 3-4:1 brown:green ratio.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Leave the lid of the composting bin open for about 30 minutes each day. Do this preferably in the afternoon, where the&#160;sunlight can speed up reactions in the compost, and make it degrade faster.&#160;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Leave the compost out of the rain.&#160;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Keep the compost moist. Every time you add material to the composting bin, sprinkle a handful of water in the composting bin, turn the compost, and sprinkle a bit more. Keeping the compost moist makes the material degrade faster.&#160;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Leave the composting bin outside.</span>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Leaving it indoors is fine, too. However, leaving it outside would allow for more fresh air to circulate through the compost through the holes in the bin. </span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Use compost booster every 3 days. Add about 2-4 tablespoons, depending on the amount of compost in the bin.</span><span style="font-size:1.29em"></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">If your compost smells, or starts to attract bugs, add more browns.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Overall, to maintain my compost bin, I found myself taking 1-2 minutes out of my day to hydrate and mix my compost. This is ideal, as a lot of people have busy schedules, and can afford to take only 1-2 minutes per day for composting.&#160;</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Compost heats up naturally. As you mix the compost, temperatures could vary from about 40 degrees C, and&#160; could even reach 80-100 degrees C in the right conditions!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">If your compost isn't heating up, add <strong>more greens.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Well, that's it! With these steps and tips, you're ready to make your own composting bin!</span></p>
