<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Well, to start off, you're going to need a few things.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Keep in mind that some of these materials can be from repurposed items, and don't have to be brand new. I'll indicate these items with an asterisk*.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">Some of these items are also optional, which will be indicated with a ^.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em"></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">A trash can*</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Cocopeat^ (you can use potting soil or pre-made compost also)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Compost booster^</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Browns &#160;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">Greens&#160;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:1.29em">A drill/soldering iron</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">That's it!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">With a maximum of six&#160;materials, you can get started with making your compost. Read through this chapter to find out the specifics of</span><span style="font-size:1.29em"> each material.&#160;</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">To make compost, two of the essentials are browns and greens. Without them, compost <strong>cannot</strong>&#160;be formed, and it's paramount that you include this. Well, what are browns and greens?&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">I've included a comprehensive list of materials which you can use as browns and greens in the following subchapters. If you live in the city or an urban area, you may not be able to find some of the materials. So, you will see a list of alternatives too, which you can use.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:1.29em">I found the total cost of all these items to be around 400 INR (Indian Rupees). You can use this <a class="link242" href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/" target="_self">currency converter</a>&#160;to look at how much this amount is in your local currency.&#160;</span></p>
